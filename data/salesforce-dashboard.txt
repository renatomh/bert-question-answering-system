What is a Salesforce dashboard?
A Salesforce dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool designed to offer real-time data and analytics for various aspects of an organization's operations, including sales, marketing, and customer service. It provides an easy-to-use interface to view important information such as lead conversion rates, deal closure rates, and revenue growth so that leaders, sales personnel, and analysts can make informed decisions based on overall performance.

Dashboards offer a holistic view of the sales pipeline, forecast accuracy, individual and team performance, and customer engagement metrics, ultimately contributing to improved sales effectiveness and business performance.

Salesforce dashboards are tailored to serve specific functions and cater to different organizational roles. By offering a targeted approach to analyzing the sales process, Salesforce dashboards empower sales leaders to identify challenges, monitor progress, and refine strategies for better results.


Why to use a Salesforce dashboard
Salesforce dashboards offer numerous benefits for sales and revenue teams looking to optimize their processes and performance. Here are some key reasons for using Salesforce dashboards, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders:

Real-time data and insights
Salesforce dashboards deliver up-to-date, precise data, such as lead conversion rates, sales pipeline health, and customer satisfaction scores. It allows decision-makers to identify emerging trends, address potential issues, and make well-informed strategic choices based on the most recent data available.


Enhanced decision-making 
Salesforce dashboards empower sales leaders and analysts with the data and insights to adjust sales strategies, scale what works, and fix what doesn’t. By leveraging these dashboards, leaders can better understand their sales processes, identify areas for improvement, and implement targeted solutions to drive growth and success.

Streamlined workflows
By embedding analytics directly into the Salesforce user interface through integration with data visualization tools like Tableau Viz Lightning, users can access relevant data and insights without switching between different platforms. This integration allows users to monitor insights while staying in tune with their usual workflows. It enhances the overall efficiency, making it easier for them to make use of acquired insights and respond to changes in the sales landscape without disruptions.


Improved productivity
Sales officers can benefit from a centralized command center for their day-to-day activities, such as meetings management, opportunity stages, and pipeline quality, leading to increased productivity and more effective time management.

Timely problem detection
Dashboards can help sales teams identify potential issues in their pipelines or sales processes early, enabling them to address these problems before they escalate and negatively impact the organization's performance.


Salesforce dashboards examples
In this section, we will explore various Salesforce dashboard examples designed to cater to the specific needs of sales and revenue teams. Each dashboard type provides unique insights and helps stakeholders monitor performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions based on the data presented as graphs, charts, and other visual structures.

How to build a Salesforce dashboard
By creating and customizing Salesforce dashboards, businesses can maximize the value of their data by having all key metrics in one place. This section will provide an overview of how to build Salesforce dashboards and discuss three popular creation methods.

Use Salesforce’s built-in dashboard functionality
One of the most effective ways to build a Salesforce dashboard is to utilize the platform's built-in dashboard functionality. With various chart types available, including bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, funnel charts, scatter charts, tables, and cards, you can design a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that caters to your business needs.

To start creating a dashboard in Salesforce, follow these steps:

Prepare your reports: Before creating a dashboard, you must have your reports ready. Reports in Salesforce are the foundation of dashboards, as they provide the data visualized in the dashboard components. To create a report, navigate to the 'Reports' tab in Salesforce, click 'New Report,' and select the report type based on the data you want to analyze. Customize the report by adding filters, grouping, and sorting the data as needed. Save the report once it's complete.
Navigate to Dashboards: Click on 'Dashboards' in the top menu. From there, you can edit an existing dashboard's components or create a new one.
Create a new dashboard: To create a new dashboard, select the 'New Dashboard' option toward the top right.
Customize your dashboard: Add components to your dashboard by clicking on 'Add Component.' Choose the appropriate chart type based on the data you want to visualize and the insights you want to communicate. Link each component to the relevant report you created in step 1.
Save your dashboard: Once you have added and customized all the necessary components, save your dashboard. It's now ready for you and your team to view and analyze the data.
Remember that building an effective Salesforce dashboard relies on your creativity and understanding of the data you're working with. Using Salesforce's built-in dashboard functionality, you can create visually appealing and informative dashboards that help your team monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. However, there are a few limitations to consider when using built-in Salesforce dashboards:

Limited data sources: The built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality primarily supports data from the Salesforce platform. If you need to visualize data from external sources, you may face challenges integrating and displaying that information.
Restricted customization options: While Salesforce offers a variety of chart types and components, the customization options may not be as extensive or flexible as those available in specialized data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau.
Scalability issues: As your business grows and the complexity of your data increases, you might encounter limitations in the built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality, which could hinder your ability to create and manage multiple dashboards efficiently.
Manual data management: Although Salesforce provides tools for managing and updating data, the process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially if you're working with large datasets or must combine data from multiple sources.
By using a solution like Improvado, you can overcome these limitations. Improvado pulls data from 500+ sales and marketing data sources (including Salesforce) and aggregates disparate datasets with each other. This enables marketing and sales teams to build a holistic dashboard that provides clear-cut insights into the company’s revenue generation efforts. 

This way, you can maximize the potential of your dashboards and ensure that your team has access to the most accurate, comprehensive, and actionable insights into marketing and sales effort. Schedule a quick consultation to discuss your analytics goals and learn how Improvado can get you there. 

Create dashboards with Einstein Analytics
Einstein Analytics is a tool within Salesforce that allows users to create interactive dashboards. By leveraging its different types of tables, including Values Table, Pivot Table, and Compare Table, users can go beyond traditional charts and widgets to provide more comprehensive insights into their data.

To create a dashboard with Einstein Analytics, follow these steps:

Navigate to the Einstein Analytics platform within Salesforce.
Click "Create" and select "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.
Start by adding a chart, widget, or one of the three tables available in Einstein Analytics.
Values Table: Provides supporting details for a chart, allowing users to drill down into the data.
Pivot Table: Summarizes datasets and presents them from a different perspective, ideal for summary data.
Compare Table: Allows for comparing different data types with unique filters for different columns.
Customize the table or chart by applying filters, modifying the appearance, or adding interactivity through faceting or bindings.
If needed, use Salesforce Analytics Query Language (SAQL) to modify the query further or make changes that can't be achieved through the point-and-click interface.
Arrange your tables, charts, and widgets to create a visually appealing and insightful dashboard layout.
Save the dashboard and share it with the relevant stakeholders.
Although Einstein Analytics offers an effective way to create dashboards, there are some downsides to consider:

Complexity: Due to its advanced features and capabilities, Einstein Analytics can be complicated to navigate for users without prior analytics or technical experience. This may lead to a steep learning curve for some team members.
Time-consuming: Building and customizing dashboards with Einstein Analytics can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets.
