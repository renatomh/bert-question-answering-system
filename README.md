# BERT Question-Answering System

## üí° Project's Idea

This is a simple implementation for a BERT Question-Answering System, in order to provide a CLI application which allow users to receive answers for questions based on contexts.

## üîç Features

* Getting answers for questions based on provided contexts;

## üìù Future Developemnt

Some interesting features which could be added to the application include:

* Web scraping to allow working with online data;
* Testing other models for performance/results;
* Unit testing;
* Better input validation;

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

## üíª Project Configuration

### Make sure to install the required packages/libs before running the script

#### * Note that the command to install PyTorch can change according to the machine where the project is being executed. Please, make sure to check the correct installation instructions for your environemnt on [PyTorch's instalation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚èØÔ∏è Running

To run the application locally, execute the following command on the root directory.

#### * Note that the first time you run the application, if you haven't downloaded the selected model yet, it might take a long time to download it, depending on the selected model. After the first run, the model binary file should be cached in your machine, and it should load faster
#### ** Update the "DATA_SOURCE_NAME" to select the file with context for which you want to ask questions

```bash
$ python main.py
```
